                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Companies typically process payroll at regular intervals. This interval varies from company to company and will often differ within the company for different employees for larger companies. The four most common pay frequencies according to research conducted in February 2019 by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics are weekly at 33.8%, biweekly at 42.2%, semimonthly at 18.6%, and monthly at 5.4%.[5] The other, much less common payroll frequencies, include daily, four-weekly, bimonthly, quarterly, semiannually, and annually.

Weekly payrolls have 52 40-hour pay periods per year and includes one 40 hour work week for overtime calculations. Biweekly payrolls consist of 26 80-hour pay periods per year and consist of two 40 hour work weeks for overtime calculations. Weekly and biweekly payrolls are the most common for nonexempt employees because they are the two that allow for the easiest and most transparent overtime calculations.</p>
